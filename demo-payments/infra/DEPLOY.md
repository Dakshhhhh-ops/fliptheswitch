# Deployment

The service runs as a container behind the acquirer's edge gateway.

- **Public API TLS** is terminated at the edge gateway, which the acquirer
  operates under their own change process. Our `src/tls.js` settings apply
  only to local and staging runs. Changing the key exchange used by real
  clients needs a change request with the acquirer's platform team.
- **Webhooks** (`src/webhooks.js`) go straight from our service to merchants.
  Some merchants verify signatures with older SDKs that only understand
  ECDSA P-256. A signature is checked once, on delivery, and is only valid
  inside the 5 minutes replay window.
- **Partner settlement files** are exchanged with the acquirer over the
  session keys from `src/session.js`. Settlement files are kept for 7 years
  under card-network rules.
- **Card vault** envelopes (`src/envelope.js`) and **customer records**
  (`src/vault.js`) are stored for the life of the customer account.
